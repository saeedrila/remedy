## Prerequisites:
### I am using VSCode for my development and its integrated terminal. Any IDE and command prompt is enough.
### I have enabled 'autosave features'. So, 'save' won't be mentioned in the follwing instructions.

## Initial setup
Create a project directory with name 'Remedy_v1' using terminal
```
mkdir Remedy_v1
```

Navigate into the newly created directory
```
cd Remedy_v1
```

Open VSCode
```
code .
```

Open the terminal inside VSCode and you should be able to see something like:
```local-machine's-name Remedy_v1 %```

## Django installation

Now install pipenv, a virual environment manager
```
pip install pipenv
```

Activate the virtual environment
```
pipenv shell
```

Install django
```
pip install django
```

Initialize a new git repository
```
git init
```

Create two file named '.env' and .gitignore
```
touch .env
```
```
touch .gitignore
```

Add .env to the gitignore file

Install 'Python-decouple' package
```
pip install python-decouple
```

Now copy the 'secret key from settings.py to .env file.
In the .env file it should be something like the following:
```
SECRET_KEY = 'the_secret_key'
```
In the settings.py file, add the following lines:
```
from decouple import config
SECRET_KEY = config("SECRET_KEY")
```

Create a django project called backend. This will contain all backend files
```
django-admin startproject backend
```

Navigate into the backend directory
```
cd backend
```

Start new app for all modules
```
python manage.py startapp authentication; \
python manage.py startapp patients; \
python manage.py startapp doctors_and_labs; \
python manage.py startapp executives; \
python manage.py startapp appointments; \
python manage.py startapp payments; \
python manage.py startapp reports; \
python manage.py startapp video_call; \
python manage.py startapp chat;\
python manage.py startapp api_v1
```

Now add all the apps into settings.py > installed apps section

Install psycopg to interact with PostgreSQL
```
pip install psycopg
```

Create a new db in PSQL
add the credentials into the settings.

Add the following lines into settings.py to make the custom usermodel to be used for authentication.

```
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'authentication.Account
```

Migrate the model to the database
```
python manage.py makemigrations
```
```
python manage.py migrate
```
Install REST and CORS for django
```
pipenv install djangorestframework django-cors-headers
```

To whitelist the frontend request, add the following lines to the backend/settings.py

```
CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST = [
     'http://localhost:3000'
]
```

Create serializer for Account.

Create sample API to check whether they are working or not 'GET' and 'POST' views. This can be confirmed using REST's default page.


# React
Created a new react app using:
```
npx create-react-app frontend
```
Then deleted .git file from the frontend directory, added necessory lines into the project's global .gitignore file.

Created assets, components, pages, routes, and store directories inside src directory. Another 'Common' directory inside the newly created componenets directory.

From frontend directory, install react-redux, redux, react router dom, reactstrap, bootstrap.
```
npm install react-redux redux react-router-dom reactstrap bootstrap
```
Install SASS related dependencies, formik and yup for form state management
```
npm install sass-loader node-sass css-loader style-loader postcss-loader formik yup
